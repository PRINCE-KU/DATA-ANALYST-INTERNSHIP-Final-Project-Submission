# DATA-ANALYST-INTERNSHIP-Final-Project-Submission
# HR Analytics ‚Äì Predict Employee Attrition üíºüìä

## üìå Objective

Employee attrition is one of the most crucial concerns in Human Resource Management. The aim of this project is to analyze HR data and uncover the key drivers of employee attrition (resignation), and to predict which employees are likely to leave the company. This allows HR teams to intervene early, improve retention strategies, and build a more satisfied, productive workforce.

Through a combination of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning models, and SHAP explainability tools, this project delivers actionable insights and a predictive system that classifies employees at risk of attrition. The insights are further visualized with Power BI to make the findings more interactive and business-friendly.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to identify trends and patterns that may be associated with employee resignations. Major findings include:

- **OverTime is a strong indicator**: Employees doing overtime show a higher chance of attrition.
- **JobRole and Department**: Certain job roles (e.g., Sales Executive, Laboratory Technician) show higher attrition.
- **Monthly Income**: Employees with lower income tend to leave more often.
- **Promotion**: Employees with no promotion in recent years are more likely to resign.
- **Years at Company**: Attrition is most common during the 2‚Äì5 year period.

All trends were visualized using bar charts, box plots, and distribution graphs with Seaborn.

## üí° SQL & Databases

1. **What are the key differences between INNER JOIN and OUTER JOIN in SQL?**  
   ‚û§ INNER JOIN returns matching records, OUTER JOIN returns all records from one or both tables regardless of match.

   ‚û§ It uniquely identifies each row in a table and ensures no duplicates or nulls.

3. **Explain the concept of normalization in databases.**  
   ‚û§ Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

4. **What is the difference between a clustered and non-clustered index?**  
   ‚û§ Clustered index defines the physical order of data. Non-clustered is a separate structure with pointers to data.
